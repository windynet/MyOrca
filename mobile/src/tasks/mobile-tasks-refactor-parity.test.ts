// Bound requests change source signatures the same way bound provider, workspace-creation and
// settings requests did: the method string and the envelope read leave the screen and an operation
// name arrives. The behaviour they used to pin is pinned by the recordings in
// mobile/rpc-foundation/goldens instead, which did not move.
//
// The screen-holdout migration takes the last two sends out of this family — the filter sheet's
// linear.selectWorkspace and the screen-root hook's repo.list. Hook, statement, declaration, render
// and style counts are all unchanged, and `semantics` is a pure deletion of four lines, none in:
// two `rpc:` call signatures and the two method literals they carried. The render-token hash moves
// because the picker's handler now names an operation instead of the client.
//
// Step 7's first half moves four of the six again, and moves nothing else. Checked readers on the
// item and list operations delete the reply casts these consumers carried, plus the three shape
// tests the reader now answers for: both `Array.isArray(payload)` guards on the checks read and the
// `typeof count === 'number'` fallback on the item count. Hook, statement, declaration and render
// counts are unchanged, and the render-token hash does not move at all — nothing this family sees
// changed inside a JSX tree. `semantics` is a pure deletion of ten lines.
//
// Round-1 review moves four, and names what each one is. The reaction reader stops matching
// `content` against an arm set mobile invented and forwards it, so `DetailComment` loses the eight
// phantom arms and `COMMENT_REACTION_EMOJI` stops being keyed by them: that is ten string literals
// gone and the `?? ''` fallback's one added, the whole of `semantics`' 3,290 -> 3,281. The eight
// alias-only bindings the deleted casts left behind (`const result = created` and its seven
// siblings) are inlined, which moves the hook and statement hashes without moving their counts.
// Only those eight: the Linear arm of task creation keeps its own `result`, which is a declaration
// with a name rather than an alias for one.
// No `rpc:` signature and no `jsx:` signature moves, the render-token hash does not move, and
// counts stay at 350 hooks, 417 statements and 194 declarations.
//
// The `gitlab.todos` fixture correction moves the same three hashes once more and no others: the
// to-do row is checked now, so the reader's cast is gone from the list-loading hook and the row
// type it forwarded is declared by what the reader proves. Counts are unchanged again, and
// `semantics` does not move, because no RPC call, runtime string or JSX host signature does.
//
// Round 2 moves two, and only because one member widens. `GitHubDetailFile.viewerViewedState` is
// `string` rather than the host's three arms, because the reader forwards it now: that is the
// declaration hash and the three arm literals, `semantics` 3,281 -> 3,278. `status` keeps its arms
// and moves nothing, because its only consumer sends it back as a param the host validates against
// the same set. Hook, statement and render hashes do not move; nothing executable changed.
